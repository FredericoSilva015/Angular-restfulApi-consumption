# Angular-ngResouce
Building on Angular using ngResource, gulp driven enviroment and less preprocessor

This is pretty much me using angular Resouce to pull API and consume them. The project started humble and simply, but i felt the need to creat a more descriptive aproach to a development enviroment.

In the end it serves like a guideline for how to set up my own enviroment and some interesting routes to speed up my own development enviroment.

I tried creating a understand on first look, or UFL aproach, i also linted heavly and tried to keep consistency.

In the end their were a few instances i considered a different aproach, and other where i went one routed went back and redone them entirely.
